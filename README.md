# MagicVilla API project with Asp.Net Core MVC

This project is an Asp.Net Core Api project that can retrieve a set of villas from the database and also by that we can do CRUD operations on villas.
For consuming the api I used a Asp.Net Core MVC project that all of the operations on villa can be done through the MVC application.
For authentication and authorization I used Identity. For comunicating with database entity framework core has been used.
